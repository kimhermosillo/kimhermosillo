        <div className='about'><p> Designing, and planning have always been incredibly fascinating to me. Being able to capture a certain aesthetic that best fits a personality can be challenging but I’m lucky enough to be entering a field where I can be creative and think outside of my own comfort zone to help other people create their vision.
        
        While most of my education is coming from a Biology background, I decided to stray away and learn something I thought would be more fitting for my lifestyle and interests, which is what led me to the web development program at Galvanize. Creating and designing apps to help others daily lifestyles is an interest of mine. I will be looking for a job mainly in the U.S., but am open to moving out of the country for front-end development, as well as back-end.
        
I’m very committed to living a healthy and proactive lifestyle, so I spend most of my free time doing strength training, running, yoga, hanging out with friends, snowboarding and hiking with my dog! Feel free to contact me for any web design/development inquiries!Designing, and planning have always been incredibly fascinating to me.
